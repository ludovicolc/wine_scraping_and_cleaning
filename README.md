This project scrapes wine data from an italian website and uses SQL to clean and organize the data.

Here's a brief description of the collected data:
* annata (vintage): year in which the grapes were grown and harvested that were used to make a specific wine.
* denominazione (provenience)
* vitigni (Vines): pure or mixed
* alcol (alcohol): percentage
* allergeni (allergens)
* consumo ideale (Ideal consumption): preferable date for consumption
* temperatura servizio (Serving temperature): Celsius
* abbinamenti (pairings): entrees, meat, fish, cheese... 
* prezzo (price): euro


The final data is stored in a PostgreSQL database and can be used for various wine-related analysis and projects.
